# node-red-contrib-html-entities
A node that wraps the `he` html entities encoder/decoder utility. Initially created for a specific project where 
3rd party HTML was parsed and function nodes filled with regex replacements were starting to get hard to maintain.

## Usage
This library contains a single html-entities node. It can be used to both encode or decode HTML entities.

## Install
You can install this node from the Node-RED palette (preferred) by searching for `node-red-contrib-html-entities` or 
directly from npm: `npm install node-red-contrib-html-entities`. For the last option, make sure you are executing 
the command from the Node-RED user directory.
